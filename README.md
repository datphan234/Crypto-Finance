Some of my projects on Data Science in the cryptoverse using python

These projects and codes are not from my ideas. At the beginning, I started investing in bitcoin and crypto currencies, fell in love with the cryptoverse and all the models I saw on the internet. This is my journey from learning python all by myself from scratch to apply python to plot models in oder to warp my head around the volatility of bitcoin price.

Please feel free to use and if you have any comments, discussion or suggestions please let me know

Thank you and all the best
